# Real-Time Color Detection using OpenCV  

## Project Overview  
This project is a **real-time color detection system** built using **Python and OpenCV**. It identifies and tracks primary colors using **HSV thresholding** and displays stable bounding boxes around detected objects.  

##  Features  
 **Detects multiple colors** (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow, Black, White)  
 **Smooth bounding box tracking** to avoid flickering  
 **Live color switching** using keyboard shortcuts  
 **Real-time processing with OpenCV**
